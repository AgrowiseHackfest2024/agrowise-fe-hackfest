# AGROWISE

## About
Agrowise is an innovative agricultural platform that connects consumers with farmers implementing sustainable farming practices through the Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) concept. Consumers can choose farmers they want to support based on profiles and reviews. The application facilitates seed purchases and manages direct deliveries to farmers. Consumers can follow the progress of their farms through updates and photos from farmers, promoting transparency. During harvest, consumers and farmers celebrate the results together, strengthening engagement in sustainable agriculture.

## Features
1. Choose Seeds: Agrowise makes it easy and efficient for consumers to choose seeds.
2. Online Payments: To simplify transactions, we have included an online payment system. Consumers can pay directly through this platform.

## How to use
Access the Application: The Agrowise application has been successfully deployed and can be accessed at https://agrowise-hackfest-2024.vercel.app/
